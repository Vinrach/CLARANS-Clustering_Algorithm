# CLARANS: A Method for Clustering Objects for Spatial Data Mining
Raymond T. Ng and Jiawei Han, Member, IEEE Computer Society

# Abstract: 
Spatial data mining is the discovery of interesting relationships and characteristics that may exist implicitly in spatial
databases. To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, we propose a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose
aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing
clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle not only points
objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering
convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to
discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with
existing spatial data mining algorithms.

# Description: 
Re-implemented the CLARANS clustering algorithm in Python for spatial data analysis, using Matplotlib for visualization.
Demonstrated strong analytical and programming skills in machine learning model training and data mining.

#Problem Statement:
In the context of university admissions, it is essential for institutions to understand the patterns and relationships between the number of students applying, the number of acceptance letters issued, and the actual enrollment figure. This can help universities optimize their admission strategies, manage resources, and predict future enrollment trends.

The problem involves clustering universities based on two primary factors:
1. Number of applications accepted by each university.
2. Number of students who enrolled after receiving acceptance letters.

The goal is to group universities into clusters that exhibit similar behavior in terms of these two variables, helping identify patterns such as which universities have higher conversion rates and which ones struggle with enrollment despite a high number of acceptance letters.
